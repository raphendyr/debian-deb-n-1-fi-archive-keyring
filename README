README for the deb-n-1-fi-archive-keyring package
=================================================

Introduction
------------

The Debian project signs its Release files that are stored on the
Debian ftp-server and its mirrors with the keys.

The private package archive at deb.n-1.fi does the same. In addition,
as the archive is not part of the Debian project, it needs to be
configured separately for every system. This package configures the
system to use packages from deb.n-1.fi and to verify the signatures.

A quick overview about this package:

* /etc/apt/sources.list.d/deb-n-1-fi.sources:
  An apt sources configuration for deb.n-1.fi.
* /etc/apt/preferences.d/deb-n-1-fi.pref:
  An apt preferences configuration to lower priorities for deb.n-1.fi,
  so packages from the official release have higher priority.
* /usr/share/keyrings/deb-n-1-fi-archive-keyring.gpg:
  A keyring including all actively used keys to sign Release files in
  the deb.n-1.fi.
* /usr/share/keyrings/deb-n-1-fi-removed-keys.gpg:
  A keyring including all keys used previously by the deb.n-1.fi, which
  are no longer supported. These keys are no longer used to sign
  Release files. The file can be used to verify old signatures.

More information about the archive authentication feature can be found
in the manpage apt-secure(8).
